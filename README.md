# BuildYourNeighborhood

For our 2020-2021 capstone project, we have developed educational game for mobile platforms, intended to help young children learn about the interactions and components within a neighborhood. The user has access to four tiles- house, road, bioswale, and wetlands, and can arrange them on a 5 by 5 neighborhood grid to raise and lower scores in three benchmarks- flood management, pedestrian safety, and housing / quality of life.

Our team members include Nathan Raymon, Jacob Lagmay, Lindy Voss, Garrett Whitehurst, and April James, and our project partner is Fatima Taha, a Geology PHD candidate at Oregon State. Her studies focus on bioswales, which are channels between the road and sidewalk which redirect rainwater runoff and harbor vegetation and trees. Taha's goal for this project is to allow users to learn about the components of the neighborhood and their interactions by playing the game, then assess their knowledge of bioswales through a survey after completing the game.

The game is developed using Unity as the game engine. This provides a way to export the game for many platforms without needing to rewrite the codebase. The game scripts are written in C#, and are used to control the mechanics of the game, such as dragging tiles, rotating the screen, and calculating score. The UI is created through Unity's UI features, the skybox is designed in Adobe Illustrator, and the tile assets are sculpted in Blender.

## Technology Required
In order to run this source code, you will need the Unity Engine. The [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) will allow you download different versions of unity and access different Unity projects. This is the [Version](https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2020.1.12) we have been using to make our game. This will ensure the version you run closely matches what we've experienced and know works. If you want to be able to build this game for anything other than a windows PC, make sure you choose the modules for the operating system you would like to build for. (ADD HOW TO GET MODULES HERE).
